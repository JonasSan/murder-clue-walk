# murder-clue-walk
This is a web game created with Spring MVC. It allows the user to register, log in and play a game that motivates the player to go outside and find certain locations to unlock new clues. The program uses geolocation to determine whether the player can retrieve the next clue and progress in the story.
AWS is used for web service hosting.

-There is still an unfixed issue with the register-form routing, if it doesn't work use the existing username: "super@gmail.com" and password: "password" to access the game
-Also the locations were set to certain locations in Stockholm, so unless you actually go there you won't be able to progress in the game.
