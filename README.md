# murder-clue-walk
This is a web game created with Spring MVC. It allow the user to register, log in and play a game that motivates the payer to go to certain locations to unlock new clues. The program uses geolocation to determine whether the player can retrieve the next clue and progress in the story.
AWS is used for web service hosting.

-There are still some occuring problems with the register function, if it doesn't work use the saved username: "super@gmail.com" and password: "password" to access the game
-Also the locations were programmed to certain locations in Stockholm, so unless you actually go there you won't be able to progress in the game.
