    <p>We are a group of developers that found ourselves struggeling to find motivation to perform some sort of exercise daily.<br>
        So we decided that we were going to solve this problem by creating a game to help people in the same shoes that we are in to get off the couch<br>
        and start heading outside to walk around and solve captivating mysteries. We also acknowledge the importance of the environment<br>
        so the designed our game for the outdoors, so that you can enjoy the game outside, while saving money and energy at home.<br>
        Our mission is simple: Solve Murders, Exercise, Save Energy</p>
